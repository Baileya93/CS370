The code I was given for the Treasure Hunt Game included a Jupyter notebook file, and two python files: GameExperience and TreasureMaze. The TreasureMaze class represents the maze environment. The GameExperience class stores the episodes that come in between the initial state and the terminal state. The Treasure Hunt notebook shows you how to play the game. 


Basically, computer scientists design, develop, and analyze algorithms, systems, and software that solve problems and satisfy different needs. Whether it's everyday apps or complex systems driven by AI or smart technologies, they build efficient and scalable solutions. computer scientists contribute to advancements that enhance productivity, convenience, and overall quality of life.

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist typically involves several key steps:
  // Define the Problem: Clearly understand and articulate the problem you're trying to solve. This involves gathering requirements, understanding user needs, and identifying constraints.
  // Research and Analysis: Investigate existing solutions, relevant technologies, and theoretical approaches. Analyze the problem to determine the best strategies and tools to use.
  // Design and Planning: Create a plan for solving the problem, including designing algorithms, system architecture, and interfaces. This often involves breaking down the problem into manageable parts and developing a roadmap.
  // Implementation: Write code or build systems according to the design. This phase includes coding, testing, and debugging to ensure that the solution works as intended.
  // Evaluation and Improvement: Assess the solution's effectiveness, gather feedback, and make improvements as necessary. Iteration is key to refining and optimizing the solution.
  
As a computer scientist, you have several ethical responsibilities:
  // Privacy and Security: Ensure that user data is protected and secure. Implement robust security measures to safeguard against breaches and unauthorized access. Clearly communicate how data is collected, used, and stored.
  // Transparency and Honesty: Be transparent about the capabilities and limitations of your solutions. Avoid misleading users or making promises that cannot be fulfilled.
  // Fairness and Bias: Strive to create solutions that are fair and unbiased. Consider how your algorithms and systems may impact different groups of people and work to minimize any potential negative effects.
  // Responsibility to Society: Consider the broader impact of your work on society and the environment. Ensure that your solutions contribute positively and do not cause harm.
  // Professional Integrity: Maintain high standards of professional conduct. Act with integrity, respect intellectual property, and adhere to ethical guidelines and best practices in your field.
